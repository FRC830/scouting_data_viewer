61,6852,False,False,False,0,4,3,0,0,0,0,1,False,not sure if there were any fouls
62,6528,True,False,False,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,False,Hydraulic based intake instead of flywheel...does not work very well but sometimes picks up a cube. Pretty ineffective.
63,2676,True,False,False,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,False,"Very abrupt drive train that jerks around a lot. Cube intake in not a flywheel but hydraulic arms, not very effective. Also it will sometimes tip over."
64,2620,True,False,False,0,3,1,2,0,0,0,2,False,"This is a pretty good robot and has the ability to climb or help another robot climb, but they did not do that in this match."
65,5205,True,False,False,0,8,5,0,4,0,0,1,False,This robot is really good at intake and depositing in both vault and switch. This would be a beneficial robot if we already had a scale-bot on our alliance. Its also pretty fast
66,5090,False,False,False,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,1,False,Robot is ok at getting cubes and putting them in switch but its sorta bad
